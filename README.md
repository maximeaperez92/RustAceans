rustaceans-src
==============

This repository is the source code for
[rustaceans.org](http://www.rustaceans.org). To add or modify your data on the
website, you want the [rustaceans.org repo](https://github.com/nrc/rustaceans.org).

The code is in two parts - `backend` is hosted at www.ncameron.org. The entry
point is `rustaceans.js`. This listens for a GitHub PR hook. It inspects the PR
and merges it then adds the data to an SQLite database. There is also a RESTful
API for getting information about rustaceans from the database. `init.js` is an
alternate stating point which will rebuild the database from the rustaceans.org
repo. This is all node.js stuff.

The `rustaceans.org` directory contains the frontend; `index.html` is the entry
point. This is a React app and is entirely client-based. It uses the
backend's API to get data.
